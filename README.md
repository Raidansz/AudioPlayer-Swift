# AudioPlayer

## Description

**AudioPlayer** is a custom audio player built in Swift using `AVFoundation`, `Combine`, and `MediaPlayer`. It offers advanced audio playback capabilities, including background playback support, handling of interruptions like phone calls, and queue management for multiple audio items. Additionally, it provides real-time updates to the Now Playing Info Center, including track information such as title, artist, and artwork.

The player features a flexible and modular design, allowing to enqueue and dequeue audio items, manage playback controls, and easily integrate with Combine to observe playback states. Itâ€™s designed for iOS applications that require a simple yet robust, scalable, and powerful audio playback solution.
